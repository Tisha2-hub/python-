The project on encryption and decryption of text and text files focuses on safeguarding data by converting readable information (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) and then reversing the process to make it readable again. It involves using cryptographic algorithms like AES, DES, and RSA to ensure data confidentiality and security during storage and transmission. The project includes designing and implementing these algorithms, managing encryption keys, and creating a user-friendly interface for encrypting and decrypting text and files. It emphasizes the importance of data privacy, secure communication, and protected file transfer, addressing challenges like key management and performance optimization. By working on this project, you gain valuable skills in cryptography, programming, and enhancing digital security.
